# Snow White

Welcome to my personal AI assistant repository! This project is built using Python and leverages various technologies such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) to create a smart and personalized virtual assistant.

## Features

SnowWhite is the first version of my personal AI assistant. The basic fratures are:

- Natural Language Processing model
- Open applications
- Search the web
- Play music and videos
- Create reminders
- Answer general knowledge questions
- Using intents.json file to recognize emotions and process using our NLP model
- and much more!

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python installed, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```
git clone https://github.com/jithu-francis017/Snow-White.git
```

Then, navigate to the repository directory and install the required dependencies and you can run the personal AI assistant using the following command: 

```
python snowWhite.py
```

## How it Works

The personal AI assistant works by using speech recognition to process voice commands, which are then analyzed using NLP techniques to determine the user's intent.

The ML and DL models used in this project need to be trained on large datasets to improve the accuracy of the assistant's responses.
